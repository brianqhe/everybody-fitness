## Problem being solved and why it needs solving
---

With the temporary closure of many gyms around Australia due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many personal trainers were unable to attract new clients, as their gyms could no longer do their advertising for them, and they were no longer able to meet prospective clients at the gym. 

According to the COVID-19 Fitness Industry Impact Report by Fitness Australia, published on April 2020, the following issues were noted - 

- 80% of gyms and sole traders reported decreased revenue and demand
- 100% of gyms made changes to their workforce including reducing work hours and letting staff go

These pose as significant problems to trainers in the fitness industry being able to help clients reach their fitness goals and make a living. 

As a result, the problem attempted to be solved by the proposed application is to allow trainers to still have a platform to be found and advertise their skills, qualifications and specialisations in a much easier way.

## Task Allocation

Tasks were tracked and allocated on the Trello Project Management platform. 

The various stages of the application development were split by columns, with the Planning stage being first. The Planning stage included developing the Entity Relationship Diagram, the wireframes for the application as well as the sitemap. 

Upon completion of the planning stage, the initial set up and its associated tasks were created. These included setting up a new project on the Ruby on Rails framework, installing the planned gems and ensuring the default puma was running correctly. 

Once complete, the relevant features and functions initially planned were each given a new category of tasks, and their respective tasks were given different cards for their priority, as well as a proposed due date. Comments were put on tasks in the case certain bugs were not fully resolved, or to keep a copy of the crucial links/information used in completing the task.
